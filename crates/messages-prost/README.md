# Common Prost Messages

This crate contains the common protobuf messages that are used by both ground station and the boards.

The Rust prost library is a fast, efficient implementation of Google Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for Rust.
- It provides a way to define structured data in `.proto` files and automatically generates Rust types from them.
- The generated Rust code is strongly typed and memory-safe.
